# Arithmetic Operators .
# let's name our variable x

x = 3

x = x + 1
# is the same as 

x += 1

# let's name our variable:2 y

y = 5

# N/B: this(*) stands for Mutliplication 
y = y*5
# is the same as

y *= 5

# Different Arithmetic Operators include :

Multiplication : y*x
Division : y / x
Addition : y + x
Subtraction : y - 5
Modulus (x mod y)(remainder) : y % x
truncate : y // x
unary minus : -x
unary plus : +x

# Different Python Operations include :

x < y : Less Than
x > y : Greater than 
x <= y : Less than or equal to 
x >= y : greater than or equal to 
x == y : Equal to
x != y : Not equal to
